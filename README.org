*News:* 

- 30may2021 Measures re-computed using INE's 2020 maps (instead of 2018 maps). Comments, critiques, and suggestions welcome by email.

- 5may2021 ~data/municipios/~ and ~data/secciones/~ now include luminosity measures for all 32 states. Validation detected a bug affecting smaller units (e.g. secciones in urban areas), producing large but short-lived surges/declines in luminosity measure. Bug has been fixed and data cleaned.

The repository distributes nighttime luminosity data for Mexico, aggregated at the municipal (N approx. 2,500) and /sección electoral/ levels (N approx. 67,000). Luminosity rasters are from [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0510-y][Li, Zhou, Zhao and Zhao]]'s (2020) Harmonized Global Nighttime Light Dataset 1992-2018. 

The source reports annual observations geo-coded at a spatial resolution of about one square kilometer (30 arc seconds). This repository summarizes pixels within each unit's territory, reporting the mean unit luminosity, the median, and the standard deviation. While the source averages (and harmonizes) pixel luminosity in /time/, this repo averages pixels in /space/. The chosen units have analytical potential, as they can be associated with census indicators, with electoral returns, and so forth. (/Secciones electorales/ are Mexico's basic units for electoral management and cartography, analogous to U.S. census tracts.)

An example from one unit clarifies the summary statistics distributed. The unit in question is electoral sección number 573 in Mexicali, the capital city of the state of Baja California. The following map shows the source's statewide data. Tijuana's luminosity can be appreciated in the northwestern tip of the state, Ensenada's slightly southward, and Mexicali's eastward. The small red area is sección 573, in the city's suburbs, towards the Colorado river delta (the river marks the border with neighboring Sonora state).

The map below zooms into the unit, portraying luminosity in sección 573 and vincinity for the year 2018. (Shapefiles for secciones electorales and municipal boundaries are from [[https://cartografia.ife.org.mx/sige7/?cartografia=mapas][INE's cartography department]].) Mean artificial lights decreased near monotonically as one progressed towards the sección's east-southeast. I relied on ~R~'s ~raster~ package ([[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html][Hijmans 2019]]) in order to summarize the unit's luminosity.

The next map illustrates descriptive statistics generation (the code for this process is in script ~code/export-seccion-stats.r~). ~R~'s ~raster::mask~ operation selects pixels inside the sección's polygon, excluding the rest (which appear in white in the map). The mean luminosity, median, and standard deviation for the selected pixels are reported in annual state-by-state files in csv format inside folder ~data/secciones~.

The time series can be appreciated in the final figure below. The sección's rapid urbanization is notable. Most of the area was quite dark in the mid-1990s, with mean nighttime lights of roughly 8GW per pixel, tripling by 2018.  The nighttime lightning aggregated in territorial units data offers a valuable indicator of human activity in Mexico's since the 1990s in small and analytically useful geographic units.
